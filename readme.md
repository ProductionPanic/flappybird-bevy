# Flappy bird clone made using bevy and rust

This is a simple flappy bird clone made using the bevy game framework and rust.
I built this project as a way to learn bevy and rust since I am new to both.

## How to run

clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProductionPanic/flappybird-bevy.git
```

run the game

```bash
cargo run
```

## Controls

all controls are done by clicking the mouse

## disclaimer

I am new to rust and bevy so the code may not be the best. I am open to any suggestions on how to improve the code.
